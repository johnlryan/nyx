NYX - Goddes of Order and Daughter of Chaos
==============

Docker, IPython Notebook, node.js, and Python orchestration
--------------

**NYX** is meant to be a Data Science tool that is deployable accross platforms, Cloud,
Windows, & Mac OS and run the same everywhere with support for machine learning, Hadoop,
and NoSQL (as well as the traditional jdbc, odbc, .csv etc) 

Supported Languages
- Python and Pandas
- R
- Java
- C/C++
- Fortran
- Nodejs

I am building out an entire system to build and deploy but at the moment it is rather
rudimentary. For the moment it depends heavily on Docker so to get your system started 
you can set up Docker and then just run the command:

    ./runapp.sh
